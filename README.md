SoundCheck_Mobile
=================

SoundCheck is an open source audio player that revolutionizes music playback. It
uses peer-to-peer communication to allow users to stream any song on their network
to any other networked computer. A single virtual library is created from separate
audio sources. Different audio streams can be played to separate locations simultaneously.

Multiple devices can be grouped together into a single zone. Each device is then
assigned a zone and synchronizes playback with other devices in the zone. Users
also have the option to use an Android mobile device as a remote control for playback and song selection.

Hardware receivers also allow users to play music through existing speaker systems
without the need for a computer via a 3.5mm headphone jack. The devices connect
to the user’s network via Wi-Fi and the playback can be controlled locally or through other devices.
